These files are all the documentation for Phoo.

All of the .html files are automatically generated by docsgen.py,
except for __header__.html, which is inserted by that script into the header of every page.
The markdown files are also converted into html. index.md is special because it will have the list
of all the pages appended after it to serve as a navigation index.

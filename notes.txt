    Settings = stack, recursionlimit, strict, nps
    Main module
    
    Spawns thread ->
        clone of settings
        own scope stack
        module
        
        ref to parent Phoo
        
        when importing ->
            looks at __main__ module recursive lookup uses cache if found
           
        looking up word ->
            has nps? find module
            no nps? look in scope stack
            scope stack can have module from import *

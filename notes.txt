    Main module
    
    spawn() -> thread
    thread() -> thread
    
    resolveNamepath() ->
        has nps? find module:
            split at nps
            call module.findSubmodule() for each
            not found -> load from network/sw cache
        no nps? look in scope stack, top down
        scope stack can have module from import *

Thread
    clone of settings
    own scope stack
    current module - defs get written here if scope stack is empty

    pause(), step(), resume() debugging commands

# Phoo

<!-- cSpell:ignore phoo -->

**Currently broken, working on getting it fixed...**

Phoo is a programming language inspired by [Quackery][], bearing resemblance to both [Forth][] and [Ruby][] at the same time, and with elements of [Python][], [Lua][], and possibly some other esoteric languages that I can't remember. And it's (mostly) bootstrapped.

Phoo is an easy-to-learn scripting language suitable for embedding. Phoo is able to leverage (most) all of the power of the Javascript environment it is run in, and is a simple and concise scripting language suitable for many applications. For those users already familiar with Quackery, Phoo tries to be a drop-in replacement.

The Phoo interpreter-compiler environment plus its (for the time being) minimalist standard library ~~are~~ **will be** distributed as a web app which can be found at <https://dragoncoder047.github.io/phoo/>. The Phoo interpreter is easily extensible and embeddable by defining Javascript callbacks for the script to hook into.
